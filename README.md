# Data Structures and Algorithms Problems/Exploration in Golang

In this repo, I am going to solved various Data Structures and Algorithms Problems in Golang.

I'm also going to be exploring data structures here and try to implement my own solutions. I'll be starting with a naive solution first, then I can move on to an improved version of the solution.

The naive solution in this case will be based on my own understanding of the Data Structure or the Algorithm (given my experience in JS/TS). Once I am done, I'll be doing some research to see how the solution can be improved or how experts in Golang tend to approach the problem.
